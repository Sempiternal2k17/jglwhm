    <p>Dear brothers and sisters, Today, I want to talk to you about decision making. We all face decisions in our lives, some small and some significant. The choices we make can have a significant impact on our lives and the lives of those around us.</p>
    <p>The Bible tells us in Ephesians 5:15-16, "Be very careful, then, how you liveâ€”not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil." This verse reminds us that we must be wise in how we use our time and make the most of every opportunity.</p>
    <p>The Bible tells us in Proverbs 3:5-6, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight." This verse reminds us that we must trust in God and seek His guidance in all of our decisions.</p>
    <p>So, how can we make good decisions? The first step is to seek God's guidance. We must pray and seek His will in all that we do. We must ask Him to guide us and give us wisdom and discernment.</p>
    <p>The second step is to seek counsel. We must seek the advice of wise and trusted individuals who can provide us with guidance and support. We must be willing to listen to others and consider their perspectives.</p>
    <p>The third step is to weigh the consequences. We must consider the potential consequences of our decisions and the impact they may have on ourselves and others. We must be willing to make sacrifices and consider the long-term effects of our choices.</p>
    <p>The fourth step is to trust in God's plan. We must trust that God has a plan for our lives and that He will guide us on the right path. We must be willing to surrender our own desires and trust in His will for our lives.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, decision making is a crucial aspect of our lives. We must seek God's guidance, seek counsel, weigh the consequences, and trust in God's plan. Let us seek to make decisions that honor God and serve others, and trust in His guidance to lead us on the right path. May God bless you all. Amen.</p>
