    <h1>Jesus feeds 5000 men</h1>

    <p>One day, Jesus went to a remote place near the Sea of Galilee to be alone and pray. However, a large crowd of people followed him on foot from the nearby towns. When Jesus saw the crowd, he had compassion on them and began to teach them about the kingdom of God and heal their sick.</p>
    <p>As the day wore on, the people grew hungry. Seeing their need, Jesus asked his disciples to find food for the crowd. However, the disciples replied that they had only five loaves of bread and two fish, which would not be enough to feed everyone.</p>
    <div class="breh">
        <div class="noice">
            <p>Jesus instructed the people to sit down in groups on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks to God. He broke the loaves and fish into pieces and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people.</p>
            <p>Miraculously, the food multiplied, and there was enough for everyone to eat as much as they wanted. In fact, there were twelve baskets of leftovers, one for each of the twelve disciples.</p>

    <p>The people were amazed by what they had witnessed. They recognized that this was a sign of God's power and that Jesus was a prophet sent from God. They wanted to make him their king and overthrow the Roman occupation, but Jesus withdrew from them and went up into the mountains to pray.</p>
    <p>This miracle of the feeding of the 5000 is often seen as a symbol of the abundance and generosity of God's provision. Despite the apparent lack of resources, Jesus was able to provide for the needs of the people through a miraculous act of multiplication. It also teaches us the importance of trusting in God's provision and sharing what we have with those in need.</p>
