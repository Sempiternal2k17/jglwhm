    <h1>Ressurection of Lazarus</h1>
    <p>John 11 : 1 - 45</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <p>The story of the resurrection of Lazarus is found in the Gospel of John. Here is the complete story</p>
    <p>Lazarus was a friend of Jesus, along with his sisters Martha and Mary. One day, Lazarus became very sick, and his sisters sent word to Jesus, who was in a different town at the time. Jesus loved Lazarus and his sisters, but he did not go to see them right away. Instead, he stayed where he was for two more days.</p>

        <div class="noice">
            <p>When Jesus finally arrived in Bethany, Lazarus had already been dead for four days. Martha and Mary were grieving their brother's death, and many of their friends and neighbors had come to mourn with them.</p>
            <p>When Martha heard that Jesus had come, she went out to meet him. "Lord," she said, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died. But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask."</p>
            <p>Jesus told her, "Your brother will rise again."</p>

    </div>
    <p>Martha replied, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."</p>
    <p>Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?"</p>
    <p>Martha answered, "Yes, Lord. I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."</p>
    <p>Then Jesus went to the tomb where Lazarus was buried. He asked the people to roll away the stone covering the entrance to the tomb. Martha protested, saying that there would be a bad odor because Lazarus had been dead for four days. But Jesus told her, "Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?"</p>
    <p>So they removed the stone, and Jesus called out in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"</p>
    <p>To everyone's amazement, Lazarus emerged from the tomb, still wrapped in his burial clothes. Jesus told the people to take off the burial clothes and let Lazarus go.</p>
    <p>Many of the people who witnessed this miracle believed in Jesus, but others went to the religious leaders and told them what had happened. The religious leaders were afraid that Jesus was becoming too popular, so they plotted to kill him.</p>
    <p>The story of the resurrection of Lazarus is a powerful testament to the power of faith and the authority of Jesus over death. It shows that Jesus has the power to raise the dead and that he is the source of eternal life for all who believe in him.</p>
