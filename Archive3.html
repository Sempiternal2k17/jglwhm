    <h1> "For the wages of sin is death."</h1>
    <p>Romans 6:23</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
    <p>Dear brothers and sisters in Christ, today I want to talk to you about the price of sin. Sin is a serious matter, and it has a high cost - not only in this life, but also in the life to come.</p>
    <p>The Bible tells us that sin is disobedience to God's commands, and that it separates us from Him. It is the root cause of all the pain, suffering, and evil in the world, and it leads to death - not just physical death, but spiritual death as well.</p>
    <p>The price of sin is high because it requires payment - payment that we cannot make on our own. The Bible tells us that the wages of sin is death, which means that sin deserves punishment. But the good news is that God has provided a way for us to be saved from the penalty of our sin.</p>
    <p>Through Jesus Christ, God offers us the free gift of eternal life. Jesus paid the price for our sins on the cross, and by believing in Him and accepting His gift of salvation, we can be forgiven and made right with God.</p>
    <p>However, we must not take this gift lightly. While salvation is a free gift, it does require a response from us. We must acknowledge our sinfulness and need for a savior, repent of our sins, and put our faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, we must also understand that sin has consequences in this life. It can lead to broken relationships, physical and emotional pain, and other negative outcomes. We must take sin seriously and strive to live a life that is pleasing to God.</p>
    <p>So, let us not be deceived by the temporary pleasures of sin, but instead, let us fix our eyes on Jesus and the eternal life that He offers. Let us turn away from sin and towards God, knowing that He is faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).</p>
