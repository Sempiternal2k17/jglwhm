    <p>Today, I want to talk to you about the importance of walking in love in our marriages. As Christians, we know that love is not just a feeling, but an action. Love is something we do, not just something we feel. And in our marriages, it is especially important that we practice selfless love and sacrifice.</p>
    <p>The Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7, "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."</p>
    <p>These words are not just meant to be read at weddings, but to be lived out every day in our marriages. When we walk in love, we put the needs and desires of our spouse before our own. We are patient and kind, even when it is difficult. We do not envy or boast or dishonor others. We are not self-seeking, but seek the good of our spouse above all else.</p>
    <p>Walking in love also means that we are willing to make sacrifices for our spouse. This might mean giving up something we want in order to meet their needs, or putting their needs above our own comfort or convenience. It means being willing to forgive and forget when we have been hurt, and to seek reconciliation instead of retaliation.</p>
    <p>This is not always easy. In fact, it can be incredibly difficult at times. But when we choose to walk in love, we are following the example of Jesus himself, who loved us so much that he gave his life for us. Jesus tells us in John 15:13, "Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends."</p>
    <p>In our marriages, we may not be called to lay down our lives in a physical sense, but we are called to lay down our own desires and preferences for the sake of our spouse. We are called to be selfless and sacrificial, just as Jesus was selfless and sacrificial for us.</p>
    <p>So let us commit ourselves to walking in love in our marriages. Let us seek to practice selfless love and sacrifice, and to put the needs of our spouse before our own. And may God bless our marriages abundantly as we seek to follow his example of love and sacrifice.</p>
    <p>Amen.</p>
