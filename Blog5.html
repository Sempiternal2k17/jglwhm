    <p>Today, I want to talk to you about the definition of success. Success is something that we all strive for in life, but the definition of success can vary from person to person. We often think of success as achieving wealth, fame, or power, but true success is much more than that.</p>
    <p>The Bible tells us in Joshua 1:8, "Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful." This verse reminds us that true success comes from obeying God's word and living a life that is pleasing to Him.</p>
    <p>So, what is the definition of success? The definition of success is not about what we achieve, but rather who we become. Success is about living a life of purpose, making a positive impact on the world around us, and growing in our relationship with God.</p>
    <p>Success is about using our talents, gifts, and abilities to serve others and make a difference in the world. It is about living a life of integrity and character, and treating others with love and respect.</p>
    <p>Success is also about growing in our relationship with God. It is about seeking Him daily, following His will, and trusting in His plan for our lives. It is about becoming more like Jesus and living a life that honors Him.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the definition of success is not about what we achieve in life, but who we become. True success comes from living a life of purpose, making a positive impact on the world around us, and growing in our relationship with God. Let us seek to live a life of obedience to God's word and use our talents and abilities to serve others and make a positive impact on the world. May God bless you all. Amen.</p>
